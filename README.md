- 👋 Hi, I’m @arentkievits
- 👀 I’m interested in high resolution imaging, correlative light and electron microscopy, volume electron microscopy and data science!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write parallel code in Python!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my project, which involves multibeam scannning electron microscopy to scan biological samples in 3D. I have to write software to analyze thousands of microscopy images.
