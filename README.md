- 👋 Hi, I’m @arentkievits
- 👀 I’m a PhD candidate interested in large-scale volume electron microscopy!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write proper documentation!
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborate! We are developing software to make 3D reconstructions from large amounts of 2D electron microscopy images originating from our novel multibeam electron microscope, [FAST-EM]{https://www.delmic.com/en/products/fast-imaging/fast-em.}
- 📫 How to reach me: A.J.Kievits@tudelft.nl
